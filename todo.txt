TODO LIST: 

STRETCH GOALS
* Hand actions - Moved to Stretch goal, because of some weirdness around message timing. Could get pulled in if requested though. Current workaround is to use dice
	* [ ] Play at random
	* [ ] Give to other person at random
* Figure out how to handle card tokens being on the map and ALSO in a person's hand
	* Potential solution: Add a new location similar to storage where tokens get moved to if they're on an image. The data is in the deckbox, but the tokens are on a map.
	* Cards should also be able to be face down on the map, with a radial menu to flip face up
* Trigger me Timbers support
* Tooltips when hovering over cards in hand
	* Even more stretch, make the tooltip only appear when the size of the tokenfield is really small
* Option toggle for automatically showing/hiding hand when switching characters? So rare this probably doesn't matter
* Add pre-check functions to all events, and get rid of immediate event type

* Face down cards in hand
	* [x] Card Manager infrastructure
	* [x] Update desktop_card windowclass to show facedown cards in hand

	* [x] Implement peek event and chat message handler
	* [x] Implement new game options
* Merge played and discarded messages into a single message when done together
* Display icons in chat for card actions	
	* Message data can have multiple icons, so this is basically easy

	* [x] Toggle whether dropping a card from a hand into chat automatically discards the card (as if it were played and discarded)
* Clean up the Deck windowclass (it still looks pre-alpha)
* Added an icon for when cards in hands or decks are missing tokens (like when you break a link)
* Allow deck list and discard pile to be viewed concurrently
* BUG: Dropping a card in the hotkey bar, then moving that card elsewhere, then clicking on the link again creates a dead card in the deck that can't be removed
	* Fixed by making cards dropped in the hotkeybar link point to a card in storage. 
	* This means that cards in the hotkey bar can't be moved around

* Hovering over a card in hand makes it pop up a little bit (or get slightly larger)
	* Changing it's size or anchor points are... complicated and buggy. Going to stick to a simple highlight frame for now.
* Figure out how to lock the hand in a location. Panels are dumb. Also I'm dumb. WINDOW.setEnabled, not control.setEnabled
