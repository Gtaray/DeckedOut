TODO LIST: 
* Add pre-check functions to all events, and get rid of immediate event type
* Add tooltip to trash bin in hand
* Display icons in chat for card actions	
	* Message data can have multiple icons, so this is basically easy
* Make consistent the locations for various radial menu options (discard, view card list, deal, etc)
* Hand actions
	* [ ] Discard at random (can also be used for 'play at random')
	* [ ] Play at random
	* [ ] Give to other person at random
* Game Option for setting the facedown hotkey
* Game option for setting the play-and-discard hotkey

ICONS
Radial
	Deal one card to one person
	Deal multiple cards to one person
	Deal one card to multiple people
	Deal multiple cards to multiple people
	View card list
	View discard pile
	View hand
	Discard one card from your hand
	Discard entire hand
	Discard one card at random
	Reshuffle back into deck
	Play card from your hand face up
	Play card from your hand face down
	Give another player a random card from your hand
Icons
	Discard pile (this is currently the trash can icon, can probably be the same as the "view discard pile" radial icon)
	Deck list (can probably be the same as the "view card list" radial icon)
	Open Deckbox (for the toolbar tray in the upper right corner)
	Decks (icon next to "Decks" in the sidebar)

STRETCH GOALS
* Added documentation to all api functions
* Merge played and discarded messages into a single message when done together
* Figure out how to handle card tokens being on the map and ALSO in a person's hand
	* Potential solution: Add a new location similar to storage where tokens get moved to if they're on an image. The data is in the deckbox, but the tokens are on a map.
	* Cards should also be able to be face down on the map, with a radial menu to flip face up
* Cards can exist in someone's hand face down
* Trigger me Timbers support
* Toggle option to display username or character name in chat when trading/showing/placing cards
* Tooltips when hovering over cards in hand
	* Even more stretch, make the tooltip only appear when the size of the tokenfield is really small
* Figure out what the heck is going on with the hand icon when dynamically setting anchor points
* Option toggle for automatically showing/hiding hand when switching characters? So rare this probably doesn't matter

DONE
* re-implement 'play and discard' hotkey
* Add per deck configuration
	* [x] Toggle whether dealt cards should be hidden from GM (both the drag token and the message in chat)
	* [x] Toggle whether discarded cards should be hidden from GM (both the drag token and the message in chat)
	* [x] Toggle whether cards are played face up for face down by default (for drag/drop and doubleclick)
	* [x] Toggle whether the GM can see cards played facedown in chat
	* [x] Toggle whether dropping a card from a deck into chat automatically discards the card (as if it were played and discarded)
	* [x] Toggle whether dropping a card from a hand into chat automatically discards the card (as if it were played and discarded)
* Clean up the Deck windowclass (it still looks pre-alpha)
* Added an icon for when cards in hands or decks are missing tokens (like when you break a link)
* Allow deck list and discard pile to be viewed concurrently
* BUG: Dropping a card in the hotkey bar, then moving that card elsewhere, then clicking on the link again creates a dead card in the deck that can't be removed
	* Fixed by making cards dropped in the hotkeybar link point to a card in storage. 
	* This means that cards in the hotkey bar can't be moved around
* Dropping a card onto a map drops a token
* OnDeckCreated and OnDeckDeleted events
* Dropping cards on entities gives cards
	* [x] CT entries
	* [x] Tokens on maps
	* [x] Character sheets
* Redo deal multi prompt window
* Deleting a character moves all their cards into the discard pile
* Option toggle for letting players drop cards in their hand
* Redo hand screen graphics
* Hovering over a card in hand makes it pop up a little bit (or get slightly larger)
	* Changing it's size or anchor points are... complicated and buggy. Going to stick to a simple highlight frame for now.
* Figure out how to lock the hand in a location. Panels are dumb. Also I'm dumb. WINDOW.setEnabled, not control.setEnabled
* Hand actions
	* [x] Discard
	* [x] Discard hand
	* [x] Show in Chat
	* [x] Place face down in chat
* OOB handler for when players drop cards from their hand onto other PCs
* Add way to view the discard pile of a deck
* Add check so when decks in the deckbox are deleted, cards from that deck are removed from all hands
* Implement other buttons on the deckbox
* Make hand screen lockable (make it a panel)
* Make hands work with new data structure
* Get drag/drop working on the hand
	* Disable drag/drop when the hand is hidden
* When a character recieves a card, auto-open their hand
* When the gm receives a card, auto-open their hand
* Separate CardManager into card, deck, and cardstorage managers.
* Add CardStorage, and intercept cards dropped in chat so that links are preserved even as cards move around
* Drag and drop onto portraits
* First pass at radial options
* Add chat messages to important card actions
	[x] Playing card faceup/facedown - OOB

ABANDONED
* The Card Table
